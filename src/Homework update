Homework #3:

-Use polymorphism with at least one abstract class 
	Created abstract Transaction class abstract method and implemented it in SellMovie, RentMovie, BuyMovie classes 

-Create and override at least one abstract method
	Created processTransaction method in Transaction Abstract class and Override it in SellMovie, RentMovie, BuyMovie classes

-Use protected modifier at least 5 times
	Used protected modifier for variables 5 times in Transaction Abstract Class and once for method processTransaction (as well as in sub classes)
	
-Override methods from class Object (toString(), hashcode(), equals()) for at least 3 classes from the hierarchy.	
	Overriden toString() 6 times (Client, Movie, RentMovie, BuyMovie, SellMovie, Transaction), hashCode() 3 times (Client, Movie, Transaction),
	equals() 3 times (Client, Movie, Transaction)
